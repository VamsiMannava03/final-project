    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        As mentioned on the homepage, I am currently pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science at California State University Fullerton.<br> 
        During my four years enrolled in university, I've had the opportunity to work in data science research and part-time as a student consultant in the Information Technology
        Department at CSUF, cultivating an interest in cybersecurity, data analysis and engineering, game development, databases, and full-stack development.<br>
        I am experienced in Python, C++, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more, which is displayed on the skills page and my <a href="VamsiMannava.pdf">resume</a>.<br>

        Outside of school and work, you may find me engaging in a variety of hobbies. I enjoy reading (my favorite genre is fantasy), gaming, watching TV and movies, 
        going to the gym, socializing, playing Dungeons and Dragons, and cooking!
