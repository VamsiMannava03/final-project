    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p> As mentioned in the homepage, I am currently pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science at California State University Fullerton.<br> 
        During my four years enrolled in unviersity I've had the opportunity to work in data science research and work part time as a student consultant in the Information Technology
        Department at CSUF cultivating an interest in cybersecurity, data Analysis and engineering, game development, databases and full-stack development. <br>
        I am experienced in Python, C++, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and more which is displayed in the skills page and my <a href = "VamsiMannava.pdf"> resume</a> <br>

        Outside of school and work, you may find me engaging in a variety of hobbies. I enjoy reading(my favorite genre is fantasy), gaming, watching TV and movies, 
        gyming, socializing, Dungeons and Dragons, and cooking!
