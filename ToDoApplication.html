    <p> The To-Do Application is a one piece themed productivity app. It's currently a work in progress but as it stands users have the following features available
        they are able to add tasks to their daily routine and schedule events using the calendar feature. The To-Do Application was developed using Swift UI in Xcode. 
        The calendar still needs work in regards to how it presents the last couple days, and the screen is a bit congested. Likewise a pomodoro timer will be added to the
        app to fit the theme of productivity.
