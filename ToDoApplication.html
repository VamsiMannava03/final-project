        The To-Do Application is a One Piece-themed productivity app. It's currently a work in progress, but as it stands, users have the following features available:
        they are able to add tasks to their daily routine and schedule events using the calendar feature. The To-Do Application was developed using Swift UI in Xcode. 
        The calendar still needs work in regards to how it presents the last couple of days, and the screen is a bit congested. Likewise, a Pomodoro timer will be added to the
        app to fit the theme of productivity.
