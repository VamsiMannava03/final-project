    <p>
        The Crying Counter is a Discord bot developed with Python. It keeps track of how many times a user says "I'm crying" and accounts for similar variations 
        such as "I am crying" and typos by using the Levenshtein Distance Algorithm. If the message is close to the original within a certain threshold, then 
        the user's count increments. The counter for each user is tracked by using a dictionary. The Discord username 
        is the key, and the value is the number of times they say a message that registers above a certain similarity threshold. 
        An SQLite3 file stores all the user information in the event that the bot crashes to ensure data isn't lost. Users can check their personal and other users' counters by using the 
        <code>!print_count @username</code> command.

        Originally, to account for more variations of the message, GPT API was integrated, but this version of the bot wasn't feasible to implement as hundreds of messages are sent in the server 
        every day, and making a call to GPT quickly got expensive.
