        The University Database is a scaled-down university database with the following entities: student, professor, course, section, and department.
        It effectively keeps track of students' majors, minors, classes, grades, and sections the professors teach. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL. 
        The most challenging part of development was linking the PHP script to the frontend.
