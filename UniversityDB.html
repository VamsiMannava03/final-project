    <p>The University Database is a scaled down university database with the following entities: student, professor, course, section, and department.
        It effectively keeps track of student's majors, minors classes, grades, and sections the professors teach. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL 
        The most challenging part of development was linking the php script to the frontend.
